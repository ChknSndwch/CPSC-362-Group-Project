Key Features:
- A playable character with basic movement mechanics such as jumping and running.

- Basic enemy AI that patrols and interacts with the player.
- Level design that includes a start and end point for progression.

 - Incorporate enemy AI behavior and movement
 - Fix Pause Menu
 - Add additional levels with more complex designs
 - Incorporate sound effects and background music
 - Implement a scoring system and collectibles
 - Introduce multiplayer functionality as a stretch goal
